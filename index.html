    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate software engineer eager to learn and build scalable
      solutions. My journey into tech started with a deep curiosity about how

    </p>

    <h2>My Goals for the School of Engineering</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Grow my skills across the board:</strong> As a developer with
        data and machine learning engineering knowledge, I find it very
        neccessary to learn backend engineering. This is because when working
        withing large organizations, it is neccessary to understand the
        underlying system where you will be deploying these ML models or
        building data pipelines
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong> Build real world projects:</strong> To develop projects that
        can be applied to solve current or real world projects
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Collaborate and network with other students:</strong> Altschool
        provides a community of developers from all programs. I hope to meet new
        people and learn from them as well as work with them to build projects.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Secure Internships or Job Opportunities: </strong>Apply the
        skills I have learnt to land a full-time job in software engineering,
        using AltSchool Africa as a solid foundation for my career.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Understand Software Architecture & System Design: </strong>
        I hope to learn how to design scalable and efficient systems that power
        high-quality software solutions.
      </li>
    </ol>
